# android

I am publishing and making available the android app I have created back in 2014.
It was a one person project. The initial idea was just to learn how to create  an android app as well as  creating a back-end service using
a functional language, scala.

After that, people liked the idea, so I ended up publishing it on google play store and it had at about 5k users. 
Unfortunately, as it was free, I had to unpublish it after one year, as I had a server running as back-end service at AWS. 
As amazon starts to charge after a one year trial, I couldnÂ´t afford keeping it alive.

The server code is inside "scala-server" folder.

The app code, inside "app" folder.

I have attached some screenshots inside "screen-shots" folder.
